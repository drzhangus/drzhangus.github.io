						Dr. Zhang is a Research Professor and Principal Investigator. He has been working side-by-side with the ERDC and HEC teams in developing Corps of Engineers watershed, riparian vegetation, water quality, and multimedia environmental modeling capabilities.
						He is the primary author of the dynamic linked water quality libraries (dlls) currently integrated with the HEC-RAS and HEC-ResSim models. He co-developed the HEC-RAS riparian vegetation module and has been a significant contributor to the latest versions (V4.5, V5.0)
						of the 2D hydrodynamic and water quality CE-QUAL-W2 model.
						He has undertaken hydraulic and water quality modeling applications for many of the major US river and reservoir systems. These include the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and Santa Ana River in California; the Columbia and Snake Reservoir and River systems;
						the F.E Walter Reservoir and Lehigh River system; St. John River; Patuxent and Potomac Rivers in Chesapeake Bay; the Minnesota River; the Missouri River; and the Mississippi River. He has extensive experience utilizing SWAT and HEC-HMS watershed models and
						spearheaded the development and application of the SWAT model for the Mississippi River Basin.
						Additionally, he has developed and lectured at various water quality modeling workshops and short courses. He provided review and technical support to federal agencies such as USACE, USBR, EPA, and FEMA.
